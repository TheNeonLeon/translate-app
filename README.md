# Assignment3-Lost-In-Translation About Project
Build an online translation tool as a Single Page Application using the React.js library.


## Description

Used the React-js library to build the following screens into this translation-app:

- The start screen
Where the application starts.
Capture a username using an input. Register if new, login if username already exists.

- The translation screen
The user can enter text into an input field and send with a button, in a textarea box underneath sign language translation will be displayed as a series of images.

- The profile screen
The profile screen shows the 10 most recent translations (or all if fewer) and allows the user to delete them from their user. Also has a logout button that logs out the user and returns them to the start screen.
